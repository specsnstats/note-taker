## Project Description:
This application allows you to take notes and have them be saved on the server for you to reference back to whenever you want. Not only that, but because of the flawed way that this is coded, you will ALSO be able to see the notes that other people have made. Maybe it will inspire you to get sh!# done?

## Usage Information:
Just click on the title section, type in your title, then click on the note section (or tab if you're one of those people...) and enter the text that you want in the note. Once you click the save button, your note will be saved on the left panel. 

If you would like to recall a saved note, just click on the note and it will populate in the right section.

If you would like to delete your note (cause lets be honest, other people reading your notes is kinda WeirdChamp), then just click the trash bin icon next to the note you wanna delete, and it will be forever erased (or will it...?)
